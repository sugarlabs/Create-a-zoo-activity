# Create a zoo

A simple HTML and JS activity, where you create a zoo by placing animals in the correct area of the zoo

## Description

Four areas, labelled birds, mammals, insects and reptiles, represent the zoo. An animal in the center of the screen is to be dragged to the correct area. If the placement is correct, the animal remains in that area, and if not, the user must reclassify the animal.

Points are awarded for each correctly classified animal. Wrong answers are also recorded
